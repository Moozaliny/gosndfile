gosndfile is a binding for [libsndfile][1]. It is distributed under the same terms (your choice of LGPL 2.1 or 3). If you install libsndfile outside of your system include and lib paths, make sure to set the environment variables CGO_CFLAGS and CGO_LDFLAGS accordingly. This package should be goinstallable, although I have only tested this against weekly-2011-09-21.
